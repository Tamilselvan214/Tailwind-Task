# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio built using only HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes:

- ✅ Home Section with resume download and avatar
- ✅ About Section with skills and education
- ✅ Projects Section with 3 project cards
- ✅ Contact Section with styled form

## Experience Building This
Creating this portfolio helped me understand the power of Tailwind CSS in rapidly building responsive, clean UI. It improved my layout skills using flex and grid, and deepened my appreciation for component-based styling.
